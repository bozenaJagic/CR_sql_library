# Chargeback Queries :credit_card:

Welcome to the Chargeback section of our SQL Query Library. Here, we have a couple of datasets that are particularly useful when dealing with chargeback rates. Each dataset comes with a brief explanation and a link to Dataplex for easy access.

## Datasets :file_folder:

### `sdp-prd-cti-data.intermediate.shop_chargeback_rates_daily_snapshot`

This dataset is your time machine. It's perfect for retrieving past values, such as the chargeback rate, chargeback rate for the last 30 days, and so on.

### `sdp-prd-cti-data.intermediate.shop_chargeback_rates_current`

This dataset is like the daily newspaper of chargeback rates. It keeps one line per `shop_id` with the most recent values. It's the same as the above, but with a focus on the here and now.

Feel free to explore these datasets and use them in your queries. Remember, this is a living document. We encourage everyone to contribute by adding new queries or refining existing ones. Let's work together to make this a valuable resource for our team.


Happy querying! :computer: :coffee:Ã’
